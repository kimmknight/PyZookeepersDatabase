# Zookeeper's Database project

Following the steps in this tutorial, you will build an application that will store/retrieve/delete the names of different animals.

To help you learn along the way, the task has been broken down into 16 individual steps.

## Before Starting

You should:

- Have Python 3.x and IDLE installed
- Know how to create a new Python file
- Know how to open an existing Python file
- Know how to run a Python file

## The Requirements

Our application will be used by an imaginary zoo. They need a way to keep track of what animals they have.

The users of the application need to be able to:

- Show a list of animals currently at the zoo (in alphabetical order)
- Add a new animal to the list when a new animal is added to the zoo
- Remove an animal if it is no longer at the zoo
- Exit the application

It should also:

- Save the list to a file when the application exits
- Load the list from a file when the application starts

It will be a text-only application and will be controlled by the keyboard.

# Planning

Before you start building an application, it is important that you have an understanding of what the requirements of the application are, what it is trying to achieve, as well an idea of what it will look like to the user.

Once you have built a few applications, this becomes easier, but when you are first starting out, this can be challenging.

To help you understand what the finished product will look like, you can [download a copy](sample/complete-ob.py) and try it for yourself.

**Note:** This is just a sample. All animal records are reset when the application closes. The code has also been "obfuscated" which means the code has intentionally been made difficult to understand.

# Steps

- [1. Display a menu to the user](step1.md)
- [2. Ask the user for input](step2.md)
- [3. Take different actions based on user input](step3.md)
- [4. Loop back to the menu after taking an action](step4.md)
