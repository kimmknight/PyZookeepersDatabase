# Step 7

## Introduction

So now we have a function that displays our animal list on the screen like so:

```
['Aligator', 'Crocodile', 'Emu']
```

This is functional, however, it doesn't look very nice to the user.

It would be ideal if the each animal was displayed on its own line, with a number next to it. For example:

```
1. Aligator
2. Crocodile
3. Emu
```

We can achieve this using a ***for loop***.

*For* loops allow us to run code a certain number of times. In our case, we will *loop* through each animal in the list.

## Objective(s)

- Create a for loop to display the animal list numbered, line-by-line

## Background Information

### For Loops



## Steps

1. Edit your zoo-manager.py file.
2. Above all other code, create a function called *display_animals()*.
3. Inside the function add a `print` statement that prints the `animals` list variable.
4. Make it so that when the user enters "1" at the menu, instead of printing `You entered 1`, the `display_animals()` function is called.
5. Save and run your program. If you enter 1 at the menu, do you see your animal list?
