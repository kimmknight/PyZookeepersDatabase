# Step 5

## Introduction

Now that we have our menu working, it's time to create a variable that will store the list of zoo animals while the application is running.

To do this, we will create a *list* variable with some animals added to it as a starting point.

## Objective(s)

- Create a list variable containing the names of some animals

## Background Information

### Lists

In Python, a standard variable can store one thing. For example:

```
username = "amy.smith"
```

or

```
total = 5
```

If we need to store multiple pieces of information, we could create more than one variable. For example:

```
user1 = "amy.smith"
user2 = "james.boo"
```

This approach has some problems. What if we need to store an unknown number of  


## Steps
UPDATE THIS
1. Edit your zoo-manager.py file.
2. Create an infinite loop using a `while 1:` statement at the top of your code.
3. Indent all other lines of your code (1 level) to add them to the loop.
4. Save and run your program. Does it work correctly? Does it return to the menu after making a selection?
